Purpose

This repository contains an HTML-based CV designed to showcase the professional profile, skills, experience, projects, education, certifications, and achievements of Talha Sattar, a Data Scientist. The CV is structured as a single-page web application, styled with modern CSS and enhanced with semi-formal interactive effects to present a professional and visually appealing resume.

Usage

The CV is provided as an index.html file that can be used in the following ways:





Online Hosting:





Host the index.html file on a web server or a static hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel) to share as a personal portfolio website.



Update the images/profile.png path to a valid image URL or local file path if hosting online.



Local Viewing:





Open the index.html file directly in a web browser to view the CV locally.



Ensure the images/profile.png file is available in the correct directory or replace it with a placeholder image.



Printing as PDF:





Open the index.html file in a browser and use the print functionality (Ctrl+P or Cmd+P) to save the CV as a PDF.



The CV is optimized for printing with a clean layout, and the print button (bottom-right corner) triggers the browser's print dialog.



The print stylesheet ensures a professional, paper-friendly format by removing unnecessary elements like the print button and background colors.



Customization:





Edit the index.html file to update personal details, add new projects, or modify styling to suit preferences.



The CSS is well-documented with classes for easy customization of colors, fonts, or layout.



Replace the placeholder images/profile.png with your profile photo.

Features





Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile devices, for accessibility.



Interactive Effects: Includes subtle hover effects, a typing animation for the name, and scroll-based section reveals for a polished experience.



Clickable Links: Social and professional links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Fiverr, Upwork) are clickable for easy navigation.



Print Optimization: Styled for clean printing with a professional layout.



Structured Layout: Organized into sections (Professional Summary, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications, Soft Skills, Achievements) for clarity.

How to Use





Clone or Download:





Clone this repository or download the index.html file.



Ensure the Font Awesome CDN link (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css) is accessible or replace it with a local copy if needed.



Update Profile Image:





Replace images/profile.png with your actual profile photo or update the <img src> path in the HTML.



Modify Content:





Open index.html in a text editor to update details like contact information, projects, or achievements.



Maintain the existing HTML structure to preserve styling and functionality.



Deploy or Share:





For online sharing, deploy to a hosting platform or share the HTML file directly.



For physical distribution, print to PDF or share the file with recruiters/employers.

Notes





The CV assumes an internet connection for the Font Awesome icons. For offline use, download the Font Awesome library and update the CSS link accordingly.



The JavaScript in the file adds subtle animations (typing effect, scroll reveals) and click interactions. No external dependencies beyond Font Awesome are required.



Ensure the profile image path is correct to avoid broken image links.
